        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>I love music both as a listener and as a creator. I have been doing music production as a hobby for a few years now, and although it is not my main focus creatively, I still enjoy learning more and getting better at it. I am also currently trying to learn how to play the piano. I plan on using my music production skills in the future for various art projects and ideas.</p>

        <h2>Learning New Languages</h2>
        <h3>(Spanish)</h3>
        <p>I have always wanted to learn more than one language and right now I am learning Spanish. I took 4 years of French in my primary education and even though I enjoyed it and had much more to learn to become fluent, I have been more interested in trying to become fluent in Spanish. Maybe after I reach a confident level in my Spanish I will return to French to learn more!</p>
